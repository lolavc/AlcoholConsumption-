# AlcoholConsumption
The research objectives are to examine and describe alcohol consumption patterns in adults aged 25 to 64 in rural, urban areas and the overall population; determine if there are statistically significant differences in harmful alcohol consumption between these areas; identify and analyse the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with harmful alcohol consumption among rural, urban, and general populations; and develop a predictive model to forecast problematic alcohol consumption within the rural population. The study will use data from the Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) series. Achieving these objectives, the study will contribute to developing tailored policies to reduce alcohol-related harm and promote health and well-being in Scotland, particularly in its rural regions.
